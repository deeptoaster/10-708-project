# BCI-GGN

## Usage

This is a repository for the project "A Probabilistic Graphical Model for Motor
Imagery Brain Computer Interfaces." This file provides instructions for running
each of the experiments in the project, and the _preprocessing_ directory
contains scripts for preprocessing BCI data as described in the paper. All of
the experiments were done by modifying code from
[GGN](https://github.com/ICLab4DL/GGN) and do not include separate scripts.
